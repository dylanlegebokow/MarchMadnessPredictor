# MarchMadnessPredictor
This software using logistic regression and gradient descent to predict the outcome of March Madness. The software uses historical data from March Madness tournaments between 1993 and 2016. It compares the difference in two teams' statistics for a game, and categorizes the output depending on if the higher-seeded team won the game.

### Prerequisits
- Python3

### Running the Software
This software can be run using the command line 
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Using the command line, ``` $cd ``` into the location you copied this repository
3. Run ``` $python get_weights.py``` to get run logistic regression using gradient descent
4. Run ``` $python predict.py``` to predict this year's bracket

### Future Work
I plan on implementing more features, cleaning up the code, adding a script file, and adding a detailed description of what the software does. 

### Built With
- Python3

### Authors
- Dylan Legebokow
